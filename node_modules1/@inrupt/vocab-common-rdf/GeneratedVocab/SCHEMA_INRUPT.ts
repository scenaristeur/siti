 * Vocabulary built from vocab list file: [common-rdf/Common/Vocab-List-Common-Rdf.yml].
 *
 * Inrupt extension to Schema.org terms providing
 multilingual alternative names (i.e. labels) and translations for comments
 (e.g. for use directly as labels or tool-tips in user interfaces or error
 messages). This extension very deliberately cherry-picks the individual terms
 from Schema.org that Inrupt currently deem generally useful for Solid and Solid
 applications (meaning we can provide a much cleaner, less noisy and smaller
 bundle size when generating programming language artifacts that provide
 convenient constants for just these selected terms, rather than including the
 over 2,500 terms currently defined in Schema.org).
